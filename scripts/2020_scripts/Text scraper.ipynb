Like many websites, we use \"cookies\" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon on other websites.

      "\n",
      "  * **Purchase and delivery of products and services.** We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.\n",
      "  * **Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.** We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve the usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.\n",
      "  * **Recommendations and personalization.** We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Amazon Services.\n",
      "  * **Provide voice, image and camera services.** When you use our voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve our services. For more information about Alexa voice services , click [here][621].\n",
      "  * **Comply with legal obligations.** In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.\n",
      "  * **Communicate with you.** We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).\n",
      "  * **Advertising.** We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our [Interest-Based Ads][622] notice.\n",
      "  * **Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.** We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?\n",
      "\n",
      "To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and\n",

      "Notice][623].\n",
      "\n",
      "##  Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?\n",
      "\n",
      "Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we\n",
      "are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to\n",
      "others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and\n",
      "with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this\n",
      "Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described\n",
      "in this Privacy Notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * **Transactions involving Third Parties:** We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.\n",
      "  * **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.\n",
      "  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.\n",
      "  * **Protection of Amazon and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use][624] and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information\n",
      "about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity\n",
      "to choose not to share the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  How Secure Is Information About Me?\n",
      "\n",
      "We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. \n",
      "  * We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. \n",
      "  * We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.\n",
      "  * Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click [here][625] for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.\n",
      "  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Amazon account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click [here][626] for more information on how to sign off.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  What About Advertising?\n",
      "\n",
      "  * **Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites:** Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our [Interest-Based Ads][622] notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the [Advertising Preferences][627] page.\n",
      "  * **Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:** We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the [Advertising Preferences][627] page.\n",
