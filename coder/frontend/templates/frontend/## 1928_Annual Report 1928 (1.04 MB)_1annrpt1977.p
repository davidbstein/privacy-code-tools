143-From the standpoint of numbers of enforcement actions, the fiscal year 1961 was one of
144:the best years in the Commission's 47-year history. It also produced important innovations
145-in the employment of enforcement tools and in the use of voluntary procedures to gain
146-compliance with the laws the Commission administers.

157-purpose is to spell out specifically how the Commission will apply the law to a particular

1240-issuing covenants not to compete, taking profits from an ACON joint venture to develop
1241-new tests, and acquiring intellectual property rights in the technology from the joint venture;

    Letter from Chairman Jon Leibowitz
126-FTC reached a settlement with Intel Corp., the world’s largest computer chip manufacturer. The settlement
127:is designed to restore competition and innovation in the market for CPUs and graphics chips that was lost
128:as a result of Intel’s alleged anticompetitive actions, while leaving room for the company to innovate and
129-offer competitive pricing going forward. On the other hand, the FTC closed its investigation of Google’s
130-proposed acquisition of mobile advertising network company AdMob, after thoroughly reviewing the deal
131-and concluding that it was unlikely to harm competition in the emerging market for mobile advertising. As

133-Consumer Privacy and “Do Not Track.” In December 2010, the FTC staff issued a preliminary privacy
134-report, proposing a framework that promotes privacy by design, transparency, consumer choice, and business

136-policies, and potential laws governing privacy, and to guide and motivate industry as it develops more robust
137-and effective best practices and self-regulatory guidelines. The report suggests implementation of a “Do
138-Not Track” mechanism, so consumers can control the collection of data about their online searching and
139-browsing activities. We’re starting to see industry support for Do Not Track. In the few months since the

    SECTION ONE:
226-COMPETITION MISSION
227:Effective and efficient antitrust enforcement promotes competitive prices and spurs innovation. The FTC
228-works hard to fulfill its mission to promote competition and protect consumers from anticompetitive mergers and business conduct that can throttle our economy and slow our economic recovery. Merger filings
229-have begun to rebound from historic lows, and the Commission’s competition work continues to support reinvigorated markets. Through enforcement, study, advocacy, and education, the FTC protects consumers by
230:ensuring that markets work well, providing lower prices, more choices, and more innovation for the future.
231-The FTC maintained an active litigation workload this year of competition matters. The Commission
232-successfully concluded its monopolization case against Intel Corporation, clearing the way for new and dynamic competition in the important market for computer chips. To settle the FTC’s charges, Intel agreed to
233-stop using a variety of exclusionary and deceptive practices that had insulated it from real competitive forces
234:for more than a decade. The Commission’s action was necessary to put competition among innovative chip
235-companies on a path for future success, unencumbered by marketing arrangements that shored up Intel’s
236-monopoly by penalizing customers who bought from rivals.

725-(damages and injunctions). The recommended changes would improve how patent law and competition
726:policy further their common goals of enhancing consumer welfare and promoting innovation.
727:Patent notice affects innovation and competition in multiple ways. Clear notice of what a patent covers can increase innovation by encouraging collaboration, technology transfer, and “design-arounds.” Poor
728-notice will undermine these benefits if potential licensees cannot find relevant patents, or if they hesitate
729-to invest in technology when the scope of patent protection is unclear. Poor patent notice can also distort
730-competition by forcing firms to design products and make investments with incomplete information on the
731-cost and availability of different technologies. The report makes recommendations for improving areas of
732-patent law that impact the notice function, including claim interpretation, specification requirements, and
733-examination practice.
734:Effective patent remedies are critical to incentives to innovate, but they also have a significant impact
735-on competition among technologies. Patent remedies protect the ability of patentees to earn returns by
736-deterring infringement, and making patentees whole when infringement does occur. Damages that undercompensate patentees and weak injunctions can deter investment in research and development and result in
737:fewer innovative products and services. Over-compensation and injunctions that cause patent “hold up,”
738:however, can lead to higher prices and encourage speculation in patent rights, which deters innovation. The
739-report recommends that courts adopt an economically grounded approach to calculating patent damages
740-that recognizes competition from non-infringing alternatives, and that courts take into account the ability of
741-injunctions to cause patent hold up based on an infringer’s sunk costs.

673-3.2.1 A Benchmark Case: Royalty Negotiations Under the Threat of an Injunction, With Zero
674-Litigation or Redesign Costs
675-In Shapiro’s setup, there is a downstream firm (D) that has already developed a product that
676:incorporates a patented innovation (held by P, the patentee). The product can be sold at a margin
677:m and unit sales are represented by X. The innovation creates value v: i.e., if the product did not
678:incorporate the patented innovation, it would generate margins of m-v. The parties engage in
679-Nash bargaining over a royalty rate r, with D’s bargaining parameter represented by β. If they do
680-not agree, then P sues D for infringement and wins with probability θ. If the patentee wins, then
681:D redesigns its product to exclude the patented innovation. If there are no litigation or redesign
682-costs, the royalty rate is r   v, and firm payoffs are  P   vX , and  D   m   v  X.

790:innovation to the overall value that is created by the downstream product. The reason is that the
791-patentee can potentially claim all surplus, regardless of how much it contributes to the product’s
792-value. Second, patent hold-up is larger the shorter the duration of litigation. To see why, imagine
793-that litigation is concluded instantaneously. In that case, if P sues, then with probability  it

799-In sum, the ability for SEP-holders to seek injunctions on sales of downstream products
800-enables them to appropriate some of the surplus that is created by the downstream firm’s
801:innovation: The ex-post surplus that is extracted exceeds the ex-ante surplus that P would have
802-captured if a negotiation had taken place prior to D’s sunk investment. The degree of holdup is

804-the shorter is the expected duration of litigation relative to the sales life of the product.

1071:futures exchanges, potentially discouraging innovation and perpetuating high prices for exchanges

1073-the control exercised by futures exchanges over clearing services has made it difficult for exchanges to
1074-enter and compete in the trading of financial futures contracts. If greater head-to-head competition for the
1075:exchange of futures contracts could develop, this would likely result in greater innovation in exchange
1076-systems, lower trading fees, and other procompetitive benefits, leading to increased trading volume. The
1077-DOJ recommended a careful review by the Treasury Department to determine whether the current

239:Efficiencies Related To Innovation
240-
241-Similar to the FTC’s analysis of merger-specific efficiencies that reduce upward pricing
242-pressure, the agency also considers how merger-specific efficiencies may improve the provision of
243:non-price benefits, such as innovation. As in any evaluation of efficiencies, the claims must be
244-cognizable, merger-specific, and verifiable. In many cases, the FTC must evaluate the possibility
245:that the merged firm will invest more in innovative activities than the sum of two pre-merger
246-companies did. Moreover, the Guidelines specify that a merger that changes the appropriability
247:conditions for firms may spur more innovation by the merged firms. However, the Guidelines also
248:recognize that efficiencies related to innovation are especially difficult to verify (as was the case in
249-this investigation) and may not be sufficient to affect short-term prices. Furthermore, efficiencies
250-are almost never sufficient to justify mergers to near-monopoly, as in the DraftKings/FanDuel case
251-(US DOJ and FTC, 2010 Section 6.4).
252-As suggested above, the DraftKings/FanDuel merger included significant consideration of
253:the effects of the merger on innovation competition and the provision of complementary services.

    role in the DraftKings/FanDuel investigation -- primarily as a consequence of the still-evolving
263-nature of the DFS industry. Both firms devoted substantial resources towards the development of
264-new features and services on their respective platforms.
265:The details of these innovative processes provide important examples of the primary
266-tradeoff, as outlined by the Guidelines, that the Bureau considered when evaluating the net effect of
267-the merger on consumer welfare: The merger could harm consumers through the loss of
268-competitive pressures that would reduce the incentive of the platform to undertake risky
269:investments to develop new products and features. On the other hand, efficiencies in innovation and
270:changes in appropriability could improve innovation incentives and increase the non-price benefits
271-enjoyed by consumers. The evidence around these arguments shows that the merger would have, at
272:best, a mixed effect on innovation and product variety and, ultimately, consumer welfare.
273-Moreover, these efficiencies were not sufficient to overcome the likely harm from a merger to nearmonopoly.
274-The merging parties both had staffs of engineers and developers that were tasked with
275-maintaining and improving the quality of the customer experience on their platforms. The intent of
276:these efforts was to attract and retain players on their sites. One important area of innovation for the
277-firms was the development of new sports offerings (e.g., golf, WNBA) or new platform features
278-(e.g., social interactions) (Federal Trade Commission 2017 pp. 14-15). While adding new sports did
279-not require the overhaul of the existing platforms, each sport required development time and testing
```

```
295-states. These requirements were an obvious potential source of synergies that would result from the
296-merger. These features were duplicative in that they required two separate teams to implement the
297-same features on each site. In addition to the extra regulatory requirements, the growth difficulties
298:encountered by the firms led to a backlog of innovative projects that the firms intended to develop
299-in order to enhance the quality of their sites.
300-The FTC investigated the possibility that the merger would allow the combined firm to
301-reduce these duplicative efforts and reallocate some of these resources to work on the backlog of
302:innovative projects. While this is a plausible source of efficiencies, the evidence was not
303-necessarily supportive of the possibility. In particular, both firms had maintained a backlog of
304-project ideas since well before the time of the merger. This is not surprising, as both firms were in a
305-“startup” phase and would likely have a list of “to be implemented” projects regardless of the
```

```
317-this environment, combining platforms essentially doubles the return on the investment with little
318-or no additional cost. Thus, a number of projects that would have a negative net present value when
319-the platforms were separate would instead be profitable to implement, which would increase
320:innovation and the benefits to consumers.
321-However, despite the backlog of projects, there was no evidence of development projects
322-that would be implemented post-merger because of increased scale. Although theory suggests that
323:mergers can benefit innovation through improving returns, without clear evidence on the number
324-9
325-
326-
    and types of projects that would result only because of the merger, the FTC could not conclude that
327-increased scale would benefit consumers.
328:The parties also claimed that appropriability of innovations was a substantial impediment to
329-investment that would be solved by the merger. As software-based platforms, DraftKings and
330-FanDuel had little recourse to intellectual property to protect their new designs or features. Both
331:firms had an established history of mimicking successful innovations by their rival (FTC 2017, pp.
332-14-15) Indeed, this history was a point of evidence on the intense competition between the two
333-firms. As discussed in the previous section, the Guidelines note that the Commission must evaluate
334-the possibility that mergers may improve the abilities of firms to capture the value of their
335:innovations.
336-While the problem of appropriability of ideas is well understood (indeed, it is the primary
337-justification for intellectual property rights), there is at least one problem with this argument in the
338-current context: Although a feature may be copied, this does not mean that the imitating firm can
339:instantaneously implement the feature. There will be some time period where the innovating firm is
340:the only supplier in the market with the new feature. This time may be sufficient for the innovator
341-to recoup the cost of the investment, despite eventual imitation. Thus, while imitation may be a
342:serious impediment to innovation, the magnitude of its effects is an empirical question.
343-Our investigation found no direct evidence that the threat of imitation ever caused one of
344-the firms not to pursue a development project. Thus, it was not clear that consumers would benefit
345-from increased appropriability.

383-The DraftKings/FanDuel merger provides an interesting case study of the consideration of
384-non-price effects and the challenges of evaluating claims about them. The interplay of platform
385:economics and innovation was the central non-price effect that was analyzed in this investigation.
386-As the above discussion details, economic theory and the Guidelines suggested a number of
387:potential innovation benefits to consumers from the merger. Clear evidence of these benefits,
388-however, was difficult to find, as it is in many mergers. There was, at best, mixed evidence that

241-Similar to the FTC’s analysis of merger-specific efficiencies that reduce upward pricing
242-pressure, the agency also considers how merger-specific efficiencies may improve the provision of
243:non-price benefits, such as innovation. As in any evaluation of efficiencies, the claims must be
244-cognizable, merger-specific, and verifiable. In many cases, the FTC must evaluate the possibility
245:that the merged firm will invest more in innovative activities than the sum of two pre-merger
246-companies did. Moreover, the Guidelines specify that a merger that changes the appropriability
247:conditions for firms may spur more innovation by the merged firms. However, the Guidelines also
248:recognize that efficiencies related to innovation are especially difficult to verify (as was the case in
249-this investigation) and may not be sufficient to affect short-term prices. Furthermore, efficiencies
250-are almost never sufficient to justify mergers to near-monopoly, as in the DraftKings/FanDuel case
251-(US DOJ and FTC, 2010 Section 6.4).
252-As suggested above, the DraftKings/FanDuel merger included significant consideration of
253:the effects of the merger on innovation competition and the provision of complementary services.
254:The potential effect of the merger on the pace of innovation by the merged firm played a central
255-
256-12
257:As in an analysis of price effects from a merger, if one firm’s innovations will not take customers from the other
258:party, then a merger of these firms is unlikely to cause a reduction in innovation that will harm consumers.

    role in the DraftKings/FanDuel investigation -- primarily as a consequence of the still-evolving
263-nature of the DFS industry. Both firms devoted substantial resources towards the development of
264-new features and services on their respective platforms.
265:The details of these innovative processes provide important examples of the primary
266-tradeoff, as outlined by the Guidelines, that the Bureau considered when evaluating the net effect of
267-the merger on consumer welfare: The merger could harm consumers through the loss of
268-competitive pressures that would reduce the incentive of the platform to undertake risky
269:investments to develop new products and features. On the other hand, efficiencies in innovation and
270:changes in appropriability could improve innovation incentives and increase the non-price benefits
271-enjoyed by consumers. The evidence around these arguments shows that the merger would have, at
272:best, a mixed effect on innovation and product variety and, ultimately, consumer welfare.
273-Moreover, these efficiencies were not sufficient to overcome the likely harm from a merger to nearmonopoly.
274-The merging parties both had staffs of engineers and developers that were tasked with
275-maintaining and improving the quality of the customer experience on their platforms. The intent of
276:these efforts was to attract and retain players on their sites. One important area of innovation for the
277-firms was the development of new sports offerings (e.g., golf, WNBA) or new platform features
278-(e.g., social interactions) (Federal Trade Commission 2017 pp. 14-15). While adding new sports did
279-not require the overhaul of the existing platforms, each sport required development time and testing
```

```
295-states. These requirements were an obvious potential source of synergies that would result from the
296-merger. These features were duplicative in that they required two separate teams to implement the
297-same features on each site. In addition to the extra regulatory requirements, the growth difficulties
298:encountered by the firms led to a backlog of innovative projects that the firms intended to develop
299-in order to enhance the quality of their sites.
300-The FTC investigated the possibility that the merger would allow the combined firm to
301-reduce these duplicative efforts and reallocate some of these resources to work on the backlog of
302:innovative projects. While this is a plausible source of efficiencies, the evidence was not
303-necessarily supportive of the possibility. In particular, both firms had maintained a backlog of
304-project ideas since well before the time of the merger. This is not surprising, as both firms were in a
305-“startup” phase and would likely have a list of “to be implemented” projects regardless of the
```

```
317-this environment, combining platforms essentially doubles the return on the investment with little
318-or no additional cost. Thus, a number of projects that would have a negative net present value when
319-the platforms were separate would instead be profitable to implement, which would increase
320:innovation and the benefits to consumers.
321-However, despite the backlog of projects, there was no evidence of development projects
322-that would be implemented post-merger because of increased scale. Although theory suggests that
323:mergers can benefit innovation through improving returns, without clear evidence on the number
324-9
325-
326-
    and types of projects that would result only because of the merger, the FTC could not conclude that
327-increased scale would benefit consumers.
328:The parties also claimed that appropriability of innovations was a substantial impediment to
329-investment that would be solved by the merger. As software-based platforms, DraftKings and
330-FanDuel had little recourse to intellectual property to protect their new designs or features. Both
331:firms had an established history of mimicking successful innovations by their rival (FTC 2017, pp.
332-14-15) Indeed, this history was a point of evidence on the intense competition between the two
333-firms. As discussed in the previous section, the Guidelines note that the Commission must evaluate
334-the possibility that mergers may improve the abilities of firms to capture the value of their
335:innovations.
336-While the problem of appropriability of ideas is well understood (indeed, it is the primary
337-justification for intellectual property rights), there is at least one problem with this argument in the
338-current context: Although a feature may be copied, this does not mean that the imitating firm can
339:instantaneously implement the feature. There will be some time period where the innovating firm is
340:the only supplier in the market with the new feature. This time may be sufficient for the innovator
341-to recoup the cost of the investment, despite eventual imitation. Thus, while imitation may be a
342:serious impediment to innovation, the magnitude of its effects is an empirical question.
343-Our investigation found no direct evidence that the threat of imitation ever caused one of
344-the firms not to pursue a development project. Thus, it was not clear that consumers would benefit
345-from increased appropriability.
```

```
382-
383-The DraftKings/FanDuel merger provides an interesting case study of the consideration of
384-non-price effects and the challenges of evaluating claims about them. The interplay of platform
385:economics and innovation was the central non-price effect that was analyzed in this investigation.
386-As the above discussion details, economic theory and the Guidelines suggested a number of
387:potential innovation benefits to consumers from the merger. Clear evidence of these benefits,
388-however, was difficult to find, as it is in many mergers. There was, at best, mixed evidence that

    innovation would increase post-merger. Moreover, maintaining competition in the marketplace
401-meant that incentives for product differentiation and the possibility of productive combinations
402-with other, non-DFS entities was preserved.
403-Most important, as the Guidelines note, merger to near-monopoly is almost never justified
404:by innovation benefits. This merger was no exception.
